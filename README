It's a copy of repository on Bitbucket that me and https://github.com/pawjo using while developing this project.

I wrote almost all front-end code (after I design how should site look like) and I some of the basic API, rest is 
the https://github.com/pawjo part (he alsohelped me with more advanced Angular things at the beggining).

Due to my mistake, I was commiting from lukasz47.
